# Lecture 3

## Encryption

- Convert the secret into something that's very hard for someone to understand
- Making it simple for authorized parties to read
- *Process of hiding information in plain sight*
- Transform secret data into something else

## Encryption Terminology

- Encr. thought of as sending a message
- Sender is S
- Receiver is R
- Attacker is O

## More Terminology

- **Encryption** -> Process of making message unreadable/unalterable by O
- **Decryption** -> Process of making the encrypted message readable by R
- **Cryptosystem** -> System performing these transformations
- **Plaintext** -> Original Form of the message (P)
- **Ciphertext** -> Encrypted form of the message (C)

## Basics of Encryption Algos

- Most algos use a *key* to perform encrypt. and decrypt.
  - Referred to as K
- Key is a secret in most cases
- Without key, decryption is hard
- With key, decryption is easy

## Terms for Encryption Algos

- Encrypt. algo referred to as E()
- C = E(K, P) --> Ciphertext
- Decrypt. algo referred to as D()
  - May or may not be the same as E()
- Decrypt. algo also uses a key

## Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption Systems

- Symmetric systems use the same keys for E and D:
  - P = D(K, C), expanding P = D(K, E(K, P))

- Asymmetric Systems use different keys for E and D:
  - C = E(K1, P)
  - P = D(K2, C)

## Characteristics of Keyed Encryption Systems

- If you change only the key, a given plaintext encrypts to a different ciphertext
  - Same as decrypt.

## More characteristics

- Ciphertext size should be the same as plaintext size
- Encryption should maximize confusion
  - relation btwn P and C should be complex
- Encryption should maximize diffusion
  - Plaintext info should be distributed throughout ciphertext

## Cryptanalysis

- Process of trying to break a cryptosystem
- Finding meaning of an encrypted message without being given the key

## Forms of Cryptanalysis

- Analyze an encrypted message to deduce its contents
- Analyze one or more encrypted messages to find a common key
- Analyze a cryptosystem to find a fundamental flaw

## Breaking Cryptosystems

- Most cryptosystems are breakable
- Job of cryptosystem designer is to make the cost infeasible

## Types of Attacks

### Ciphertext only

- No knowledge of plaintext or details of algo!
- Must work with probability of distributions, patterns of common characters, etc.
- Hardest type of attack

### Known Plaintext

- Full or partial
- Cryptanalyst has matching sample of ciphertext and plaintext
- Or may know something about what ciphertext represent
  - E.g. IP packet with its headers

### Chosen Plaintext

- Cryptanalyst can submit chosen samples of plaintext to the cryptosystem
- Recover the resulting ciphertext
- Clever choices of plaintext may reveal many details
- Differential cryptanalyst iteratively uses varying plaintexts to break the cryptosystem
  - By observing effects of controlled changes in offered plaintext

### Algorithm and Ciphertext

- Cryptanalyst knows the algo. and has a sample of ciphertext
- BUT NOT THE KEY, and can't get any more similar ciphertext
- Can use "exhaustive" runs of algo. against guesses at plaintext
- Password guessers often work this way

### Timing Attacks

- Usually assume knowledge of algorithm
- And ability to watch algorithm encrypting and decrypting
- Some algorithms perform different operations based on key values
- Watch timing to try to deduce keys

### Key Attacks

- If you know the key, decryption is easy
- Some attacks try to determine the key
- Brute force is simple
- depending on key selection methods, more sophisticated attacks are possible

## Basic Encryption Methods

### Substitution Ciphers

- Substitute one or more characters in a message with one or more different characters
- Using some set of rules
- Decryption is performed by reversing the substitutions

#### Caesar Cipher

- Translate each letter a fixed number of positions in the alphabet
- Reverse by translating in opposite direction

#### Breaking Caesar Cipher

- Identify or guess the kind of data
- Count frequency of each encrypted symbol
- Match to observed frequencies of unencrypted symbols in similar plaintext
- Provides probable mapping of cipher
- The more ciphertext available, the more reliable this technique
- Brute force attacks would work as well

#### More Complex Substitutions

- Monoalphabetic Subs: Each plaintext letter maps to a single, unique ciphertext letter
- Any mapping is permitted
- Key can provide method of determining the mapping
  - Key *could* be the mapping

#### Polyalphabetic Cipher

- Ciphers that don't always translate a given plaintext character into the same ciphertext character
- Use different subs. for odd and even positions

### The Unbreakable Cipher

- There is a "perfect" subs. cipher
- One that is theoretically unbreakable without the key
- One time pad!!

### One-Time Pads

- Essentially use a new substitution alphabet for every character
- Substitution alphabets chosen purely at random
  - The key
- provably unbreakable without knowing this key

### Security of One-Time Pads

- If the key is truly random
- Need one bit of key per bit of message, tho
  - key dist. is painful
- Synchronization of keys is vital
  - Keys must be the same across all receivers
- A good random number generator is hard to find

### One-Time pads and Cryptographic Snake Oil

- Companies regularly claim they have "unbreakable" cryptography
- Usually based on one-time pads
- But typically misused
  - Pads distributed with some other crypto mechanisms
  - Pads generated with non-random process
  - pads reused

### Permutation Ciphers

- Instead of subbing diff. characters, scramble up existing characters
- Use algo. based on the key to control how they're scrambled
- Decryption uses key to unscramble

### Characteristics of Perm. ciphers

- Doesn't change the chars in the message (just where they are)
- Character frequency analysis doesn't help the attacker

### Columnar Transpositions

- Write the message chars in a series of columns
- Copy from top to bottom of first column, then second, etc.

#### Attacking Columnar Transpositions

- Trick is figuring out how many columns were used
- Use info. about diagrams, trigrams, and other patterns
- Diagrams are pairs of letters that frequently occur together
- For each possibility, check diagram frequency
