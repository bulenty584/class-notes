# Lecture 2: Security Principles, Policies, and Tools

## Economy in Security Design

- Economical to develop and use and verify
  - How much effort do you need to put into the design of the system
- Should add little to no overhead
  - Work the computer has to do to achieve security (very few extra instructions)
- Should only do what needs to be done
- Keep it simple and small

## Complete Mediation

- Everytime there is a decision whether or not something should happen, you determine whether it is ok to do that
- Apply security on every access to a protected object
  - Each read of a file, not just the
- Also involves checking access on everything that can be attacked

## Open Design

- Design the system in such a way that even if the attacker knew every single detail of implementation, they still can't do anything!

- Doesn't necessarily mean to publish source code
- Obscurity can provide some security but brittle

## Separation of Privileges

- Provide mechanisms that separate the privileges used for one purpose from those used for another
- Allows flexibility in security systems
  - e.g. Separate access control on each file
- Different passwords for every web site you use

## Least Privilege

- Give bare minimum access rights required to complete a task
- Require another request to perform another type of access
- The more complex your system is, the more important this principle is
- The more general, the less important because you're going to support other functionality

## Least Common Mechanism

- Avoid sharing parts of the system's mechanism
  - Among different users
  - Among different parts of the system
- Coupling (sharing mechanism among different entities) has the possibility of a security breach
  - If it isn't shared they can't see it

## Acceptability

- Mechanism should be simple to use
- Simple enough that people will use it without thinking about it
- Must rarely ever or never prevent permissible accesses
- Sometimes expressed as principle of least astonishment
  - Any special actions required make sense

## Fail-Safe Designs

- Default to a lack of access if there is a problem!
  - Don't allow it to happen
- If something goes wrong or is forgotten or isn't done, no security lost
- If mistakes are made you'll find out
  - Without loss of security
- You want a default but not in a situation where people get denied often when they do something legitimate!

## Security Policies

- Should describe how a secure system should behave
- Policy says what *should* happen! Not how you achieve that
- Generally if you don't have a clear policy, you don't have a secure system

## Informal Security Policies

- E.g. Users should be able to access their own files, in most cases
- E.g. Only authorized users should be able to log in
- E.g. System executables should only be altered by system admins

## Formal Security Policies

- Typically expressed in a mathematical security policy language
- Tending towards precision
  - Allowing formal reasoning about the system and policy
- Often matched to a particular policy model
  - E.g. Bell-La Padula
  - E.g. Biba Integrity Policy

## Bell-La Padula Model

- Corresponds to military classifications
- Combines mandatory and discretionary access control
- Two parts:
  - Clearances
  - Classifications

## Clearances

- Subjects (people, programs, etc.) have a **clearance**
- Clearances describe how trusted the subject is

## Classifications

- Each object (file, database entry, etc.) has a **classification**
- Describes how sensitive the object is!
- Uses the same categories as clearances
- Informally, only people with the same or higher clearance should be able to access the object

## Goal of Bell-La Padula Model

- Prevent any subject from ever getting read access to data at higher classification levels than subject's clearance
  - Don't let untrusted people see your secrets
- Concerned not just with objects
- Also concerned with the objects' clearances

## Bell-La Padula Simple Security Condition

- Subject S can read object O iff lo <= ls

## Why aren't we done then?

- We really care about the info in an object
- A subject with top secret clearance can read a top secret object
- If careless, he could write that info to a confidential object

## The Bell-La Padula *-Property

- S can write O iff ls <= lo
- Prevents *write-down*
  - Privileged subjects writing high-classification info to low-classification objects
- Can be proven that system is now secure

**Bell-La Padula doesn't allow write-down!**

## How do you really use the system?

- There have to be mechanisms for reclassification
  - Requireing explicit operation
- Danger that reclassification process will be done incautiously
- Real systems also use classes of info
  - Least common mechanism

## Biba Integrity Policy

- Subject S and object O
- Set of ordered Integrity levels I
- Subjects and objects have integrity levels
- Subjects at high integrity levels are less likely to screw up data
  - trusted users of audited programs
- Data at high integrity level is less likely to be screwed up
  - it badly needs to not be screwed up
- We REALLY care about writing

## Biba Integrity Policy Rules

- Subject S can write to O if i(o) <= i(s)
  - higher level can write to lower level/same level objects
- s1 can execute s2 iff i(s2) <= i(s1) (person and program)
- A subject s can read object O iff i(s) <= i(o)
- Figure out reason why we need read-rule --> Read down?

## Hybrid Models

- Issue is keeping things separated
- Chinese Wall Model
  - Integrity and confidentiality
  - Make sure that information between two clients don't get leaked to each other
  - Set up a chinese wall
    - Separate employees and resources and have complete discretion (set of different computers and no communication between employees)

## Problems With Security Policies

- Hard to define properly
  - How do you determine what to allow and disallow?
  - Hard to go from policy to the mechanisms that actually implement it
  - Hard to understand implementions of policy

## Tools for Security

### Physical Security

- Do not led bad guys put their physical hands on your assets
- Lock up your computer
- Doesn't work so well if you have networking or a smart phone!
  - Jailbreaks in smart phone
- In any case, lack of physical security makes other measures pointless

### Access Controls

- Only let authorized parties access the system
- A lot trickier than it sounds:
  - Particularly in a network env
    - Your computer has no control over your piece of data
- Once data is outside of your system, how can you control it??

### Encryption

- Algorithms to hide the content of data or comms
- Only those knowing a secret can decrypt the protection

### Authentication

- Methods of ensuring someone is who they say they are
- Vital for access control

### Encapsulation

- Methods of allowing outsiders limited access to your resources
  - Preferably making inaccessible things invisible
- Let them see or access some things
  - BUT NOT EVERYTHING
  - virtual machines and sandboxes

### Intrusion Detection

- All security methods sometimes fail
- When they do, notice something is wrong
- Take steps to correct the problem
- Reactive, not preventative
  - Unrealistic to believe any prevention is certain
- Must be automatic to be useful

### Access Control

- Trick is to give access to only the right people
  - And at the right time and circumstances

### Goals for Access Control

- Complete mediation
- Least privilege
- Useful in a networked env.
- Scalability
- Acceptable cost and usabiity

### Access Control Mechanisms

- Access control lists
- Capabilities
- Access control Matrices
  - theoretical
- Role based

### Language of Access Control

- Subjects are active entities that want to gain access to smth (users or programs)
- Objects are things that could be accessed (files, devices, database records)
- Access is any form of interaction with an object
- An entity can be both subject and object

### Mandatory vs. Discretionary Access Control

- *Mandatory Access Control* is dictated by the underlying system
  - Individual users can't override it
  - Even for their own data
- *Discretionary access control* is under command of the user
  - System enforces what they choose
  - More common than mandatory
- Most systems use discretionary access control

### Realities of Discretionary Access Control

- Most users never change the defaults on anything
  - Unless the defaults prevent them from doing something they want to do
- Most users don't think about or understand access control
- Probably not wise to rely on it to protect information you care about
  - unless you're the one setting it
  - and you know what you're doing

### Access Control Lists

- For each protected resource, maitain a single list
- Each list entry specifies a user who can access the resource
  - And the allowable modes of access
- When a user requests access to a resource, check the ACL!

### ACL Terminology

- Subjects and objects

### Issues for ACLs

- How do you know requestor is who he says he is?
- How do you protect the access control list from mod.
- How do you determine what resources a user can use?

### Pros and Cons of ACLs

+ Easy to figure out who can access a resource
+ Easy to revoke or change access permissions
- Hard to figure out what a subject can access
- Changing access rights requires getting to the object

### Capabilities

- Each subject keeps a set of data items that specify his allowable access
- Essentially a set of tickets

### Properties of Capabilities

- Must be unforgeable
  - In a single machine, keep capabilities under control of the OS
    - Users don't have control in their own hands
    - Subject can't create capabilities, but may ask the OS
  - What about a Networked System?
    - Tricky, since you can't guarantee who an object came from
- In most systems, some capabilities allow creation of other capabilities
  - Process can pass a restricted set of capabilities to a subprocess

### Revoking Capabilities

- Option 1: Destroy the capability
  - We have to know where it is
  - E.g. multiple machines, we must go through all of them worst case
- Option 2: Revoke on use
  - Requires checking on use (keeping a record of capability)
- Option 3: Generation numbers
  - Requires updating non-revoked capabilities
  - Change the capability generation (v5 to v6, only updating some)
  - Need to go to everyone and make sure they update all their copies!

### Pros and Cons of Capabilities

+ Easy to determine what a subject can access
+ Sometimes can be faster than ACLs
+ Easy model for transfer of privileges
- Hard to determine who can access an object
- Requires extra mechanism to allow revoking capabilities
- Need cryptography in a networked app

### Distributed Access Control

- ACLs still work OK
  - Provided you have a global namespace for subjects
  - And no one can masquerade
- Capabilities are more problematic
  - Security relies on unforgeability
  - Provided by cryptography methods
  - Prevents forging, not copying

### Role Based Access Control

- An enhancement to ACLs or capabilities
- Each user has certain roles he can take while using the system

### Example of Role Based AC

- Change roles based on the task!
- **Changing roles prevent access that previous role had**
  - Ex. Fred can't see his emails when he is sysadmin role

### Changing Roles

- Role based access control only helps if changing roles isn't trivial
- Typically requires providing some secure form of authentication
  - Proves you have access to role

### Practical Limitations on Role Based Access Control

- How many roles can you have per user
- Problems of disjoint role privileges
- System admin overheads
- Generally, these cause usability and management problems

### Refernce Monitors

- Access control must be instantiated
  - Checks if given attempt to refernce an object is allowed
- code is called a **reference monitor**
