## Malicious Code Attacks

- Attackers write programs: program causes problems

- Often used as a stepping stone to ransomware attacks
  - Someone prevents a site from being able to access their data unless they pay a ransom

- Stuxnet worm targeted at nuclear facilities

- Increasing attacks on infrastructure systems
  - Power, water, sewage, gas, etc.

## Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS)

- Attackers prevent the service from being performed
  - By exploiting vulnerabilities
  - By generating lots of traffic

- Extremely hard problem to solve

## SolarWinds attack

- Supply Chain attack

- SolarWinds is a company that builds and manages IT (All components of digital components of a company)

- Orion software was compromised and then got deployed to all their clients

## Results of the Attack?

- SolarWinds software controlled the customers' systems
  - Major corps, gov't

- Corrupted version was controlled by hackers

- Hackers controlled the customers' systems

- Similar supply chain problem hit 6k customers!

## The Log4j Vulnerability

- Programming flaw in a popular package for java program logging

- Allows attacker to force a server to execute arbitrary remote code
  - Game-over (system is totally compromised)

- Very widely used in many kinds of programs

- Not a new or sophisticated type of flaw

## Legacy and Retrofitting

- Legacy issues constrain security

- Going back to fix in an existing piece of software and hardware is very hard to do

## Problems with Patching

- Usually done under pressure (quick and dirty)

- Tends to deal with obvious and immediate problem

- Hard to get patch to everyone

- Patches can introduce new security problems

## Security and Protection

- *Security* is a policy

- *Protection* is a mechanism
  - Protection mechanisms implement security policies

## Vulnerabilities and Exploits

- Vulnerability is  weakness that can allow an attacker to cause problems

- An exploit is an actual incident of taking advantage of a vulnerability

  - Allowing an attacker to do something bad on some machine
  - Refers to code or methodology used to take advantage of a vulnerability

## Transitive Trust

- I trust Alice Alice trusts Dan, etc.

- Chain of certificates

- Code that calls code that calls code are important cases of transitive trust

  - this is how we build modern systems

## Security Goals

- CIA

  - Confidentiality
    - Keeping something secret

  - Integrity
    - Keeping data undeprecated, don't let someone change something they shouldn't

  - Availability
    - Don't let someone stop others from using services

## Active vs. Passive Threats

  - Active threats more aggressive: Causes rapid change (computer crash)

  - Passive Threats are forms of eavesdropping (No modification, injections of requests, etc.)

  - Passive threats are mostly to secrecy

  - Active threats are to all properties

## Social Engineering

- Phishing
  - Attackers pose as someone else or send media posing to be for something else

  - Fake email, phone call, etc.

## Principles of easiest penetration

- Intruder must be expected to use any available means of penetration
- Pretty much means they are willing to exploit ANYTHING
