## Compilers

- Compiler is a program that translates an executable program into an executable program in another language

- We expect the program produced by the compiler to be better in some way than the original

## Structure of Compilers (Abstract Views)

- Source code --> Machine code
  - Errors in the program are reported
  - Runtime errors vs. compile time errors

IN PRACTICE:

1. Source code --> frontend (written independently to architecture)
2. Frontend --> backend (written independently of language being compiled)
3. Backend --> machine code

Sparrow is our IR (frontend to backend conversion) (intermediate representation)

## Front end

1. Source code --> scanner --> parser --> IR

2. Errors can be caught in scanner and parser step

3. Scanner takes ASCII and translates it into tokens (==, etc.)

4. Parser checks sequence of tokens and if it follows the language grammer

Two faces on frontend since we can do one face with regex, but other face with parser

## Back end

IR --> Instruction selection --> register allocation --> Machine code

1. Errors can be caught at selection and allocation stage

2. Instruction selection

3. Register allocation

  - value in register when used
  - Problem is to use registers that promotes fastest compilation
  - Optimal allocation is difficult

## Optimizations

- Middle end (in btwn frontend and backend)
- largest part of compiler
- goal is to reduce runtime

## Scanner

- maps characters to tokens (basic unit of syntax)
- character string value for a token is a lexeme

## Specifying Patterns

- Scanner must recognize parts of the language's syntax

- Identifiers
  - alphabetic followed by k alphanumerics

- Numbers

  - integers, decimals, reals, complex

## Regex to code

### Recognizers

- From a regex we can construct a DFA (deterministic finite automata)


## Automatic consruction

- Construct a dfa
- Use state minimization techniques
- Emit code for the scanner
